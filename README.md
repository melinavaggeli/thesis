Web application for understanding data mining algorithms from banking
data through visualization for educational purposes 

The app: https://creditcardapp.shinyapps.io/app_1/

It's an online application implemented with the shiny package of the statistical language R.
The process is based on banking data and includes techniques such as decision trees, Naive Bayes algorithm, correlation rules, etc. Our main goal is the interaction that such an online application offers to the user. Through this interactivity, it is possible to explore, by changing the parameters of each model and creating an adaptation of the presentation of information to the individual needs of each user, so that it can be easily converted into knowledge and encourage learning.
